# Design Revision Summary

## Changes Made Based on User Feedback

### 1. Removed All "User Level" Complexity

**What was removed:**
- `x-visibility` field with values: `"exposed"`, `"advanced"`, `"expert"`, `"hidden"`
- Any concept of "expert mode" or "advanced mode" toggles in the UI
- `visibility_levels` array in `x-metadata` section

**What remains:**
- **Only** `x-depends-on` for progressive disclosure
- Fields appear when their dependencies are met
- Simple, flat UI with conditional visibility based on actual selections

### 2. Progressive Disclosure Mechanism

**The ONE AND ONLY visibility mechanism:**

```json
{
  "x-depends-on": {
    "features.rag": true,
    "providers.vector_db": "qdrant"
  }
}
```

Fields appear when ALL conditions in `x-depends-on` are true (AND logic).

**No other visibility controls exist.**

### 3. Updated Files

- ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Removed visibility level concepts
- ✅ `SCHEMA-DOCUMENTATION.md` - Removed x-visibility documentation
- ✅ `SCHEMA-SKELETON.json` - Removed all x-visibility fields
- ✅ `SCHEMA-SKELETON.json` - Removed visibility_levels from x-metadata

### 4. Validation

All JSON files validated successfully after changes.

## Design Principle Clarification

**Progressive disclosure is achieved through:**
1. **Feature toggles** → enable features
2. **x-depends-on** → show provider selection when feature enabled
3. **x-provider-fields** → show provider-specific config when provider selected
4. **x-affects-services** → auto-enable services based on provider choice

**No artificial complexity.** No "levels" or "modes."

## What This Means for Implementation

### For UI Developers

- **Simple logic:** Check `x-depends-on` conditions, show/hide fields
- **No mode toggles:** Don't implement "beginner/advanced/expert" buttons
- **All fields available:** Just conditionally visible based on other fields

### For Schema Authors

- **Don't use x-visibility:** It doesn't exist
- **Use x-depends-on:** Only mechanism for conditional fields
- **Keep it simple:** If user needs a field, make it depend on relevant selections

### Example Flow

```
User opens form
  └─ Sees: Network config, Services list, Features toggles

User enables features.rag
  └─ providers.vector_db field appears

User selects providers.vector_db: "qdrant"
  └─ qdrant_url field appears
  └─ qdrant_api_key field appears

User selects providers.vector_db: "pgvector"
  └─ qdrant_url field disappears
  └─ qdrant_api_key field disappears
  └─ (no additional fields needed for pgvector)
```

Clean, simple, predictable.

## Acknowledgment

User feedback:
> "no 'user levels' whatsoever. no advanced or expert mode. this is not wanted."

**Response:** Completely removed. Progressive disclosure through `x-depends-on` only.

> "i am not satisfied at all with the example structure but this will do as a starting point."

**Response:** Acknowledged. Current structure serves as foundation for iteration. Open to restructuring based on further feedback.

## Next Steps

1. Continue fleshing out complete service definitions in schema.json
2. Define all provider-specific fields
3. Map all 370+ OpenWebUI environment variables
4. Create resolution engine logic
5. Build RJSF form generator

No visibility levels. Just progressive disclosure through dependencies.
